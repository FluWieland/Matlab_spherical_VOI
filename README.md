# Matlab_spherical_VOI
Contains the Matlab 2017 Code for cutting spherical VOI from stacks of images used for 3D reconstruction
The GUI is based on the assumption that the user has used either Bruker DataViewer (cordinates origin left bottom) or ImageJ Fiji (origin top left) to determine the coordinates of the centre of the spherical VOI to be cut. Various options to calculate the centre are implemented and optional a separate 3D viewer is impemented but deactivated as comment.

If you have questions regarding details of the script, contact me under flu.wieland@gmail.com
